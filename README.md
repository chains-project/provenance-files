# SBOMs

Long term storage of build provenance files / software bills of material (SBOM)

## How are SBOM generated?

### SLSA

SLSA is not a tool for generating an SBOM, but rather a set of requirements for the SBOM.
Currently, the SBOM is generated by [this action](https://github.com/slsa-framework/github-actions-demo), which produces SBOM formatted as an [In-toto attestation](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation), which is the currently recommended format for an SBOM by SLSA.

There is a workflow called [sbom.yml](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/master/.github/workflows/sbom.yml) in Spoon that automatically
generates the provenance files for Spoon project for every commit to `INRIA/spoon:master`.

### Sonatype-Lift

1. Go to [sonatype lift console](https://lift.sonatype.com/results/github.com/SpoonLabs/sorald/01GF3EZ99T224KCGHP20Y32671?tab=dependencies)
   and click the "dependenices" tab.
2. Click "Export CycloneDX" button to export the SBOM in JSON format.

### Renovate

1. Inspired from Renovate's ["Detected dependecies"](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/sorald/issues/623).
2. Run the following command and you will get the list of
   "Detected dependencies" in STDOUT and the log file.
   ```bash
   renovate --token [REDACTED] --dry-run="extract"  --autodiscover --autodiscover-filter "<org_name>/<repo_name>" --log-file="renovate.log"
   ```
   One may use Renovate's npm package or docker image to the run the
   above command.
3. See https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/18258#discussion-4463299 for more information.

### CycloneDX

### CycloneDX maven plugin

1. Execute the maven-plugin at the root of the maven project.
```sh
$ mvn org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin:2.7.3:makeAggregateBom
```
2. The SBOM (`bom.json` and `bom.xml`) is written inside the target folder.
