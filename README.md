# SBOMs

Long term storage of build provenance files / software bills of material (SBOM)

## How are SBOM generated?

### SLSA

SLSA is not a tool for generating an SBOM, but rather a set of requirements for the SBOM.
Currently, the SBOM is generated by [this action](https://github.com/slsa-framework/github-actions-demo), which produces SBOM formatted as an [In-toto attestation](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation), which is the currently recommended format for an SBOM by SLSA.

There is a workflow called [sbom.yml](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/master/.github/workflows/sbom.yml) in Spoon that automatically
generates the provenance files for Spoon project for every commit to `INRIA/spoon:master`.

### Sonatype-Lift

1. Go to [sonatype lift console](https://lift.sonatype.com/results/github.com/SpoonLabs/sorald/01GF3EZ99T224KCGHP20Y32671?tab=dependencies)
   and click the "dependenices" tab.
2. Click "Export CycloneDX" button to export the SBOM in JSON format.

### Renovate

1. Inspired from Renovate's ["Detected dependecies"](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/sorald/issues/623).
2. Run the following command and you will get the list of
   "Detected dependencies" in STDOUT and the log file.
   ```bash
   renovate --token [REDACTED] --dry-run="extract"  --autodiscover --autodiscover-filter "<org_name>/<repo_name>" --log-file="renovate.log"
   ```
   One may use Renovate's npm package or docker image to the run the
   above command.
3. See https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/18258#discussion-4463299 for more information.

### cdxgen

1. Install cdxgen npm package.
   ```
   sudo npm install -g @appthreat/cdxgen
   ```
2. Run.
   ```
   cdxgen -t java -o bom.cdxgen.json
   ```

> It seems that is uses CycloneDX maven plugin under the hood.

### CycloneDX maven plugin

1. Execute the maven-plugin at the root of the maven project.
```sh
$ mvn org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin:2.7.3:makeAggregateBom
```
2. The SBOM (`bom.json` and `bom.xml`) is written inside the target folder.

### jbom

1. Ran Spoon as CLI command and ensured that it would take long to end.
2. Quickly ran jbom on another terminal lise so:
```sh
$ java -jar jbom-1.2.jar -p <process id>
```

### Highlight Automated Code Scan

1. Download the tar ball from the link below.
2. Run the following command from the HLCS directory.
```sh
java -jar HighlightAutomation.jar --workingDir  ~/chains/sbom-files/sorald/ --sourceDir ~/spoonlabs/sorald --skipUpload --technologies "Java"
```

Link to tool: https://doc.casthighlight.com/product-tutorials-third-party-tools/automated-code-scan-command-line/

The tools generates a lot of CSV files that can be uploaded to 
[Highlight Platform](https://learn.castsoftware.com/trial-hl-request?utm_page=https://learn.castsoftware.com/highlight)
(proprietary) to view the results.

### FOSSA

1. Click 'Start for Free' and then follow the steps.
